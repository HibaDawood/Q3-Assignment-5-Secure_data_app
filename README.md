## üîê Project Showcase: Secure Data Encryption System with Python & Streamlit

### üõ°Ô∏è Project Overview

This application provides a secure way to encrypt sensitive information using cryptographic techniques. Users can store data with unique passkeys and retrieve it only with proper authentication, simulating real-world security systems used in enterprise environments.

### üîë Key Technical Features:

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Implemented Fernet encryption from Python's cryptography library for secure data protection
- **Password Hashing**: Utilized SHA-256 hashing to securely store passkeys without exposing raw credentials
- **Authentication System**: Built a multi-attempt verification system with automatic lockout after failed attempts
- **In-Memory Data Storage**: Created a secure session-based storage system that leaves no persistent data traces
- **Interactive UI**: Developed a clean, intuitive interface using Streamlit's powerful components


### üíª Technologies Used:

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit for the web interface
- Cryptography library for encryption/decryption
- Hashlib for secure password hashing
- Session state management for secure data handling


### üß† Skills Demonstrated:

- Cryptographic implementation
- Secure authentication workflows
- State management in web applications
- User experience design for security applications
- Python programming best practices


This project reflects my interest in cybersecurity and my ability to implement secure systems while maintaining excellent user experience. It demonstrates practical application of encryption concepts that are essential in today's data-sensitive world.
